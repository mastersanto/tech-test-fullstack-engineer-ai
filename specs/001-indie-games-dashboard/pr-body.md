# Submission

- **Name:** Jorge Sandoval
- **Email:** jorgeivansandoval@gmail.com
- **Time spent:** about 2 hours by commit timestamps (16:51–18:55): ~1 h for the core
  assessment and the chat panel (16:51–17:50), ~30 min for the Nocturne redesign
  (18:27–18:55, after the design export), plus the initial Spec Kit planning session before
  the first commit

## What I built

An internal dashboard for an indie games catalog, plus a streaming AI chat that answers
questions about it by calling tools.

- **Dashboard (`/`)**: one page in a dark design ("Nocturne", from a Claude Design handoff
  in `design/003/handoff/`). It has a dense table with each game's developer and genre,
  revenue bars, sortable columns, and search and genre filters kept in the URL. A right rail
  holds the assistant, or the add/edit form when editing, so the table stays in view.
  Validation runs in the browser and again in the API, from one shared schema. Deletes ask
  for confirmation in a dialog, and changes confirm with a toast. Below 1280 px the rail is an
  "Ask AI" drawer. Editing, filtering and sorting never reset the conversation.
- **REST API (`/api/games`)**: list, get, create, update, delete, with structured errors
  that list each failing field.
- **AI chat**: AI SDK 7 `ToolLoopAgent` on Claude with four narrow tools
  (`search_games`, `rank_games`, `count_games`, `get_games`). The catalog is never put in
  the prompt. Replies stream, and each tool call shows as a lookup chip so you can see where
  every number came from. **Games an answer is about light up in the table**, taken from
  the tool results the browser already has.
- **Storage**: SQLite through Drizzle and better-sqlite3, seeded with 12 games on first run.
- **Process**: spec-driven with Spec Kit inside Claude Code, in three features. 001 is the
  dashboard, API and chat. 002 moves the chat onto the dashboard after a UX review. 003 is the
  Nocturne redesign from a design handoff. Each feature's spec, plan, contracts and tasks
  were committed before its code. See `AI_WORKFLOW.md`, including where the AI got things
  wrong.

## How to run

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local     # set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
npm install                    # Node 22+
npm run dev                    # http://localhost:3000
```

`npm test` runs 44 unit tests. `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build` all
pass. Verified against the production build: 10/10 scripted chat questions answered
correctly, and a 58-check Playwright run. That run covered layout at 768–1440 px, editing in
the rail, search/sort/URL state, answer highlights, keyboard and Escape behaviour, and
contrast (5.05:1 on the lowest-contrast text).

## Trade-offs

- SQLite file with `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, no migrations; enough for one table.
- Requires Node 22+ (better-sqlite3 13 ships prebuilt binaries, so nothing compiles).
- Defaults to Claude Opus 5.5 at low effort. Lookup chips appear in 1–2 s, while answer
  text starts at 2.5–4.5 s (two model calls per answer). `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` switches to a
  faster model. All 10 scripted test questions were answered correctly.
- Chat history lives in the browser session only.
- Dark-only by design. Highlights from a "how many" answer cover at most 20 games (the count
  tool lists its first 20). Filtering runs on the server per request, with no pagination;
  fine for tens of games.
- Next 16 Cache Components: reads call `connection()` so production never serves a
  build-time snapshot of the database.
- Automated tests cover the data layer, the tools, URL parsing and highlight extraction. UI
  behaviour was checked with a scratch Playwright script and by hand, not with a committed UI
  test suite.
- Auth, deployment and production error handling are out of scope per the brief.
