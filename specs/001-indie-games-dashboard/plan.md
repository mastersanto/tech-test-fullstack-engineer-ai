# Implementation Plan: Indie Games Dashboard

**Branch**: `submission/jorge-sandoval` | **Date**: 2026-10-17 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)

**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-indie-games-dashboard/spec.md`

## Summary

Build a single Next.js 16 (App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind 4) application that exposes an
indie-games catalog three ways: a dashboard table with add/edit/delete, a JSON REST API, and a
streaming chat assistant. The catalog lives in one SQLite file accessed through a single
Drizzle repository module; the REST routes, the dashboard, and the assistant's tools all call
that module. The assistant is a Vercel AI SDK `ToolLoopAgent` backed by Anthropic
`claude-opus-5-5` (env-overridable) with four narrow lookup tools; it never receives the
catalog in its prompt, and replies stream to the UI over the AI SDK UI-message protocol with
tool calls rendered as visible "lookup" chips.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript (strict) on Node.js ≥ 22 (developed on 24.18; `better-sqlite3`
13 requires ≥ 22). `.nvmrc` = `24`, `package.json` `engines.node = ">=22"`.

**Primary Dependencies**:
- `next` 16.4 (App Router, Turbopack dev), `react` 19.3, `tailwindcss` 4
- `ai` 7.0 (Vercel AI SDK core + UI protocol), `@ai-sdk/anthropic` 4.0, `@ai-sdk/react` 4.0
- `drizzle-orm` 0.45 + `better-sqlite3` 13, `drizzle-zod` 0.8, `zod` 4
- Dev: `vitest` 5, `eslint` (create-next-app default), `@types/better-sqlite3`

**Storage**: SQLite file at `data/games.db` (git-ignored via existing `*.db` rule). Created,
`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`-ed and seeded on first open when the file is absent. No
migration tool.

**Testing**: Vitest, two small suites only — `tests/repository.test.ts` and
`tests/tools.test.ts` — run against an in-memory SQLite instance. Everything else is verified
manually via [quickstart.md](quickstart.md). Full coverage is out of scope per the brief.

**Target Platform**: Local developer machine (Linux/macOS/Windows), one Node process,
browser at `http://localhost:3000`. No deployment.

**Project Type**: Web application — one Next.js project serving UI and API together.

**Performance Goals**: First visible assistant token < 3 s (SC-003) — achieved with
`effort: 'low'` on the Anthropic provider; dashboard with 100 games renders < 2 s (SC-007);
REST calls complete < 100 ms locally (synchronous SQLite, single table).

**Constraints**: 2–3 hour time box; no auth, deployment, or production error handling; no
containers; API key and model supplied via `.env.local`; the full catalog MUST NOT be placed in
the prompt (FR-014).

**Scale/Scope**: Tens of games, one operator, ~12 seed rows, ~15 source files, 3 pages
(dashboard, chat, shared layout), 3 API route files, 4 assistant tools.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

| Principle | Gate | Status |
|---|---|---|
| I. Time-boxed scope | Every planned file maps to a requirement or mandatory deliverable; no auth, deploy, containers, pagination, or chat persistence | PASS — see Project Structure; non-goals listed below |
| II. Tool-calling AI | Assistant fetches data only through typed tools; prompt holds instructions, not rows; responses stream | PASS — `ToolLoopAgent` with 4 tools, `createAgentUIStreamResponse`; see [contracts/assistant-tools.md](contracts/assistant-tools.md) |
| III. Single source of truth | One data-access module; shared validation schema across UI, API, tools; six fixed fields + id | PASS — `src/lib/games/repository.ts` is the only importer of the DB client; `drizzle-zod` schema reused by API routes, form, and tools |
| IV. Simplicity & readable code | Flat layout, no speculative abstraction, every dependency justified, lint + `tsc` gates | PASS — 9 runtime deps, each justified in [research.md](research.md); no ORM migrations, no state library |
| V. Documented AI workflow | `AI_WORKFLOW.md` written incrementally | PASS — tasks phase will insert checkpoints after each milestone |
| Tech constraints | Next 14+, TS, Tailwind; provider/model via env; local storage; seed data; `.env.example` | PASS — all present in structure below |

**Explicit non-goals** (would violate Principle I): authentication, Docker/compose, Server
Actions alongside REST (REST is the deliverable; the UI consumes it), pagination/search/sort,
chat history persistence, multi-month revenue history, i18n.

**Post-Phase 1 re-check**: design artifacts introduce no new dependencies or layers beyond the
table above. Gate still PASS. Complexity Tracking left empty.

```

**Structure Decision**: Single Next.js project with `src/` (create-next-app default). UI, API
and AI live in one process so the assistant's tools call `repository.ts` in-process rather
than over HTTP. The dashboard server component also reads `repository.ts` directly; only
browser-initiated mutations go through the REST routes (and thereby exercise the deliverable).
`lib/db/client.ts` is imported solely by `lib/games/repository.ts` (Principle III).
