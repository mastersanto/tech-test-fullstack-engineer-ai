# Contract: Home Page Layout & Chat Panel

**Scope**: The user-facing contract for `/` after this feature. The APIs (`/api/games*`,
`/api/chat`) are unchanged; see
[001 contracts](../../001-indie-games-dashboard/contracts/).

## Routes

| Path | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `/` | Header (app name) · page title + "Add game" · catalog table · assistant |
| `/chat` | `307` redirect to `/#chat` (no page file) |

## Layout by viewport width

| Width | Table | Assistant | Controls |
|---|---|---|---|
| **≥ 1024 px** | left column, `minmax(0, 1fr)` | right column, 400 px, sticky under the header, full remaining viewport height; message list scrolls inside; always shown | none |
| **< 1024 px** | full width | off-screen drawer from the right (`max-w-md`, full height) over a dimmed backdrop | "Ask AI" button next to "Add game"; close (×) button in the drawer header |

Container: `max-w-[1440px]`, 24 px side padding, 24 px gap between columns. The page itself
never scrolls horizontally. The table may scroll horizontally inside its own bordered
container at 1024 px.

## Panel / drawer header

`Assistant` title · short helper text ("Answers come from live lookups…") · the close (×)
control on narrow screens only. The `ChatView` body (messages, suggestions, error banner, input) is unchanged
from 001, apart from filling the available height.

## Interactions

| Action | Result |
|---|---|
| Add / edit / delete a game | Table refreshes; conversation and any streaming reply are untouched |
| Ask AI → close → Ask AI (narrow) | Conversation intact; input focused on each open |
| Resize across 1024 px | Conversation intact; panel or drawer follows its own state |
| `Escape` with drawer open and no form dialog open | Drawer closes, focus returns to "Ask AI" |
| `Escape` with the add/edit form open | Only the form closes |
| Click on backdrop | Drawer closes |
| Load `/#chat` (or `/chat`) | Narrow: drawer opens and input is focused. Wide: input is focused. Hash removed from URL |

## Accessibility

- The drawer while open on narrow screens: `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`,
  `aria-label="Assistant"`. The panel on wide screens: a plain `<aside aria-label="Assistant">`.
- Toggle buttons have `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` pointing at the panel id.
- The closed drawer is `inert`, so its contents can't be tabbed into while off-screen.
- The add/edit form `<dialog>` (top layer) always renders above the drawer.
