## Notes

- Validated 2026-10-17, iteration 1: all items pass.
- Pixel widths (1024 px breakpoint, 360–440 px panel) are UX requirements, not implementation
  choices. They make "side by side" and "narrow screen" testable, and the breakpoint matches
  001 FR-024.
- The former chat address (`/chat`) is mentioned only as a user-visible URL to redirect, not
  as an implementation detail.
- Supersedes 001 FR-022. 001's other chat requirements (FR-012 to FR-021) carry over
  unchanged via FR-012.
- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`
